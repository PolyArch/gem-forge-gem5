/*************************************************************************
 * This provides the interface between MinorCPU and GemForge.
 *
 * GemForge accelerators assume an out-of-order execution that:
 * 1. In-order dispatch, mem-ref instructions will be inserted int LSQ (e.g.
 *    first user instruction of a stream element).
 * 2. Out-of-order issue, when dependence is ready.
 * 3. In-order commit.
 *
 * MinorCPU is an in-order CPU that:
 * 1. In-order issue to FU, when all dependence is ready.
 * 2. Mem-ref instructions are inserted into LSQ when coming out of the FU
 *    (vaddr ready, earlyMemIssue).
 * 3. In-order commit.
 *
 * The major differences are:
 * 1. In MinorCPU, FU is strictly before the LSQ, i.e. instructions in the
 *    LSQ have no access to the FU. This means that a dummy StreamLoad is
 *    required to travel through the LSQ and maintain the memory order.
 * 2. The LSQ entry is not reserved at issue time, but after completing
 *    the FU.
 *
 * To solve this, we add a PreLSQ to hold instructions that require
 * monitoring memory aliasing information before inserted into the LSQ,
 * e.g. StreamLoad, as these instructions represent an memory access way before
 * dispatching. This PreLSQ can be unordered.
